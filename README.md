Email verification using Python.

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive email verification tool written in Python. It includes various features to validate email addresses, check their deliverability, and identify disposable or role-based accounts. The tool uses multiple techniques, including DNS checks, SMTP verification, and web scraping, to ensure accurate results.

## Features

- **Email Format Validation**: Validates the format of email addresses using regular expressions.
- **DNS Checks**: Verifies the existence of MX and A records for the domain.
- **SMTP Verification**: Checks if the email address is deliverable by communicating with the mail server.
- **Disposable Email Detection**: Identifies disposable email addresses.
- **Role Account Detection**: Detects role-based email addresses (e.g., admin@, support@).
- **Catch-All Domain Detection**: Identifies domains with catch-all configurations.
- **Domain Age Check**: Determines the age of the domain using WHOIS data.
- **Web Scraping**: Uses Selenium and BeautifulSoup to verify email addresses on login pages of known providers.
